It started with the objective of building a tool for **empowering** people through the use of software tools.

The first steps taken were:

- Conduct a **Lean Inception** (Paulo Caroli) to clarify the main objectives, ideas, and functionalities of the project. The result was a **prioritized list of functionalities**, an **elevator pitch**, and a **MVP canvas**.
- Work on Proofs of Concept to obtaint the key data.
- Start a Rails API project with a CI pipeline.
- Build a simple endpoint showing the key data.
- Dive deep deeper RSpec testing framework.
- Built the GraphQL API.

The project is _still_ in development and this blog post exists as a step toward building the backend that will consume the GraphQL API.
